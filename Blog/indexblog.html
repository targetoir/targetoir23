          Just wondering if you know of a method as how we can setup remote video conference with our mom ahead of time as well as able to stream video (YouTube) to her favorite show.</p><br>
          <p><i>"We are moving our mom into a senior home care as her dementia is getting worse, and out of concern for her safety, we have to other choice but to move her into the facility that managed to keep COVID away by restricting outside visit at this time.</p><br>
          <p>My siblings and I live in same country but not same city as my mom; therefore, we would like to set up a video time with her. In the past at her own home, we would come in and set it all up so that we can monitor her with video and etc. until [a caregiver came] in."</i>
          </p><br>
          <p>However, with Covid, the senior care already informed that any technology would have to pre-program ahead of time as all the facility would do is plug into the power but they would not do anything else due to the many policies in place.
