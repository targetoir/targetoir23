        <p>Technology will allow us to keep with our loved ones in touch. For others that are not as technologically savvy, it can be exceptionally difficult. With her problem.</p><br><p>
          Just wondering if you know of a method as how we can setup remote video conference with our mom ahead of time as well as able to stream video (YouTube) to her favorite show.</p><br>
          <p><i>"We are moving our mom into a senior home care as her dementia is getting worse, and out of concern for her safety, we have to other choice but to move her into the facility that managed to keep COVID away by restricting outside visit at this time.</p><br>
          <p>My siblings and I live in same country but not same city as my mom; therefore, we would like to set up a video time with her. In the past at her own home, we would come in and set it all up so that we can monitor her with video and etc. until [a caregiver came] in."</i>
          </p><br>
          <p>However, with Covid, the senior care already informed that any technology would have to pre-program ahead of time as all the facility would do is plug into the power but they would not do anything else due to the many policies in place. Our mom would not be cognitive enough to know and push on the tablet.</p>

      <h3>Consider a smart display for far-away family members</h3><br>
      <p>The facility staff can not mess with you with a computer, and can just just plug it in, because there is a laptop-based system. You may be able to set up and tilt a mobile to face your mom and just dial in, but that's a horribly tiny image. It would be easier with a smartphone, but there's an even better solution: buy your mom's smart show. Intelligent displays are pretty foolproof. When you've wired one of them into an</p>

        <p>While political disagreements among family members are nothing new, the rifts formed over the past five years feel different.

          In some cases, strongly liberal or conservative relatives went from having an unspoken agreement to avoid discussing politics, to declaring certain family members with opposing viewpoints "Dead to them." The 2016 election exacerbated existing political polarization, galvanizing both sides throughout the duration of the Trump administration.<br></br>
          
          For some Trump supporters, it marked a turning point.<br></br>
          
          After seeing images of tear gas being released in the Rotunda as their fellow Trump enthusiasts waved confederate flags, they reached the point of no longer wanting defend or support the president.<br></br>
          
          Still, for some families with right-wing uncles coming to grips with recent events, there is currently a window of opportunity to have productive political discussions and begin to reconcile.<br></br>
          
          Other families may see various members becoming even more radicalized after last week, and now have to decide how-and whether-to continue to maintain any type of relationship with them.<br></br>
          
          Tell us in the comments: Has last week's attack on the U.S. Capitol been a turning point for your family? Was it the last straw for members who formerly supported Trump, but now see him in a different light, and want to make amends? Or has it deepened existing political divides, perhaps causing your family to reach the point of cutting certain members out completely, and giving up on any chance of mending fences? If you've had initial conversations about reconciling and moving forward, what strategies have worked? And what have you tried that didn't work-or made things worse?</p>

        <p class="author-caption">I’m a romantic. I love skies that are blue, trees that are green and mornings that are good.<br></br>

          I love literature and I adore words—perhaps the hand that writes them even more so. Beautiful words, Gregorian chants and laughter are, in my amphibious opinion, the loveliest sounds in the world.<br><br>
          
          I am certain of very few things, but those that I am certain of can never be changed. Fregs will always be a blessing to this world, and pasta will remain the greatest delicacy known to man.<br></br>
          
          It seems that I have rambled long enough, though there’ll be plenty of bluer skies to come. Have a snazzy day. </p>
